# Node Finance Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate to get up and running quickly with the Node Finance React Native SDK.

This boilerplate is the first of many, and will be the most bare-bones of the bunch. If you are a developer who is particular about your repository setup or the technologies you use in your application, then this is the right boilerplate for you. This boilerplate essentially covers all dependency setup for the Node SDK suite
